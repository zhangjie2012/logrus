* logrusredis - a logrus hook can log to redis

usage checkout =example/main.go=

/just worked for personal./

** basichttp

if you don't have a business server, like pure Android/iOS app, but you still want some store log and do some data analysis job.

In this scenario, your can use =basichttp= as a proxy, insert log to redis directly(do not write one line code).

=go build -o loghttp basichttp/main.go=

** performance

write to redis will cause latency, if your server very high performance requirements, don't use this.
